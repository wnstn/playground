# Playground

A simple, lightweight Sinatra app with all my favorite tools baked in so I can easily jump in and start prototyping an idea or exploring a toolset.

Want to play around yourself? It's simple to get started after you clone the project from Github, assuming you have Ruby installed on your machine and are comfortable with the command line:

1. `cd` into the directory you cloned it into
2. run `gem install bundle`
3. run `bundle`
4. run `guard`
5. visit http://localhost:9393 in your browser
